       <p>Canvas is a powerful tool in HTML5, it allows you to draw shapes,images, and animations directly on your webpage. Canvas can be used to make games too!</p>

        <h2>Why do you use Canvas?</h2>
        <p><strong>Game Maker</strong></p>
        <p>If you ever want to build a simple, retro game like snake, pong or a matching game, a tower defense masterpiece,
            or a slick space shooter. You need Canvas. It allows you to manually control every single pixel
            its exactly what you need for fast, high-performance animations. If you need effects for a game. Canvas handles it quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
        <p>The biggest, non-fun reason is efficiency. If visual content is too complex for basic HTML/CSS (like thousands of moving particles or a large 3D scene), the browser will often hand the rendering work to the computer's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).
           Canvas, especially when used with its 3D context (WebGL), is highly optimized to talk directly to the GPU, making the process incredibly fast and smooth for the end-user.
 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Make cool shapes</strong></p>
         <p>You can draw cool shapes. But you can also do complex designs, standard shapes, curves, patters, even blinking lights</p>
