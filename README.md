HTML5 Canvas Demo Project

A three-page website demonstrating the use of HTML5 Canvas to draw custom graphics using JavaScript. This project includes a homepage describing Canvas as a presentation tool, plus two dedicated pages showcasing a centered circle and centered rectangle, each styled and drawn using custom-built Canvas code.

This project was created to deepen my understanding of Canvas paths, fills, coordinate systems, and rendering techniques as part of my ongoing journey in web development.
